<h1>IPfy</h1>

IPfy is platform to list and license copyrighted and patented work. 

Problems:
1. IP registering and licensing is a resource intensive task often requiring expensive legal assistance.
2. Addtionally, creators who provide open source creations/inventions are not appropriately attributed and rewarded. 
3. It is difficult to asses the vallidity of new inventons and creations.

Solutions:

People can use IPfy to record their IP on blockchain, license it to users for a fee (fee optional), where all IP license transactions are also recorded on-chain. Potential licensors and licensees have a chat function to communicate for clarifactions. The above stated problems are thus resolved:
1. External invervention(legal and ors) can be avoided, by automating the licensing process. The creator must only provide details of their IP and its curresponding registration ID. Addtionally, for creators/inventors who want to register their property, but don't have the means to do so with a govt./govt. recognised authority, they may record it on the platform and have a timestamped proof of their creation, serving as reliable evidence. They may also apply for IPfy grants for official registration. 
2. Creators who publish license fee free work, to promote innovation, shall be attributed if other users use their work. Any person(s) creating new work, relying on another open source work, will display the open source invention/creation card on their profile. Users are also given the CHOICE to make small payments to suppport the open source creators/inventors. 
3. Potential popularity and utility of the invention/creation may be identified by evaluating the transaction history of the license, recorded on the blockchain. 

Buisness Model:
 
A small percent of the fee paid for license is sent to the platform
